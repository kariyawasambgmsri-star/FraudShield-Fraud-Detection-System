# FraudShield-Fraud-Detection-System
A Streamlit-based ML project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions
FraudShield: Credit Card Fraud Detection System

 Project Overview

FraudShield is a machine learningâ€“based system designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.
It analyzes transaction patterns, balances, and transaction types to predict the likelihood of fraud.
The project uses *Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit* for model development and deployment.

 Objectives

* Identify patterns in financial transaction data.
* Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.
* Build a user-friendly web app using *Streamlit* for real-time predictions.
* Improve transaction security through data-driven insights.

System Architecture

Modules of the Project:

1. Data Preprocessing & EDA â€“ Data cleaning, visualization, and class imbalance handling.
2. Model Development â€“ Training and evaluating ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
3. Web App (Streamlit) â€“ User interface for entering transaction data and viewing predictions.
4. Documentation & Deploymen â€“ README, project report, and app deployment.
